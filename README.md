another idea that I have is to creating an interactive narrative experience, where users will have to solve crimes using their type skills. The last "chapter" / "challenge" here would bee to make your own challenge or story for other users to solve. At this stage I am playing around with a few ideas. I would like to explore different approaches considering that there are a bunch of different kinds of learners.
